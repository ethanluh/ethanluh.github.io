  <left><p class="clearfix"><b class="firstphrase">My name is Ethan Luh</b> and I am 12 years old. I enjoy fencing, mathematics, and Igo(Go). I want to go to Nueva because of the following two reasons. I need a school where I can mathematically advance my knowledge, and I need a school that can support my love of fencing. During primary school, I went to Synapse School. Synapse was able to support my love of fencing; in fact, they let me travel whenever I wanted. However, at Synapse School, though they were strong in other areas, could not push me past my limits in math. For the past two years, I have been going to Bullis Charter School. Bullis was able to help build a strong foundation for my math skills but were strict on when and why I could leave. Bullis also prevented me from taking a statistics course that I qualified for at Foothill college. Bullis math is definitely not as challenging, and this is why I take three other math classes outside of Bullis. I believe Nueva can allow me to pursue both of my passions, and that is why I would like to go to Nueva. 

<br></br>
As I said in the Student Questionaire, I enjoy fencing, programming, reading, gymnastics, and violin, but I didn't say much about why I chose them. I started getting really interested in reading in first and second grade at Synapse, a school similar to Nueva. When I was taught to read, I was interested. My teachers taught me to read and understand words by having us sound out the syllables and look at similar words. In this way, we were to guess at the meaning of the words. When I found a book that I wanted to read, I read it until I knew every word in it. I enjoyed books, magazines, anything that I could get my hands on. This is why I enjoy reading so much. Violin, on the other hand, I started not because of anyone else, but because I wanted to do all the things violinists can do. Piano, which was the instrument that I played before, is fun, but it requires you to stay still, in your seat. The keys are set and can't move, and everything is there for you. A piano is also the base for all other instruments in my opinion because you can do almost anything on the piano, and it is easier to learn theory and tempo. Violin, on the other hand, there are millions of places you can place your fingers on the strings, and you are free to move around. That is why I chose the violin instead of a piano.
